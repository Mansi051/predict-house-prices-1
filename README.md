# Linear Regression in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** in Python to predict housing prices in different cities based on multiple features.

The model predicts house prices using the following features:

# Size (sq ft)

# Number of rooms

# Age of the house (years)

It supports multiple cities, making the model realistic and applicable to real-world housing datasets.

## Features
# Predict housing prices using multiple input features.

# Multiple Linear Regression implemented with scikit-learn.

# Separate scripts for:

Assigning training sets manually.

Taking user input to predict house prices.


## Requirements
# Python 3.x

# NumPy

# scikit-learn
