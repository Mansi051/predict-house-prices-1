# Linear Regression in Python

## Overview
    This Multiple Linear Regression model estimates real estate prices for independent houses/bungalows 
    using synthetically generated data inspired by real-world trends in mid to upper residential localities 
    across major Indian cities

The model predicts house prices using the following features:

 - Size (sq ft)

 - Number of rooms

 - Age of the house (years)

It supports multiple cities, making the model realistic and applicable to real-world housing datasets.

## Features
 - Predict housing prices using multiple input features.

 - Multiple Linear Regression implemented with scikit-learn.

 - Separate scripts for:

      -> Assigning training sets manually.

      -> Taking user input to predict house prices.


## Requirements
  - Python 3.x

  - NumPy

  - scikit-learn
